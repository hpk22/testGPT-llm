Multimodal LLM-Based Testing Instruction Generator
This tool uses a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to generate detailed testing instructions for digital product features based on screenshots. By uploading screenshots and providing optional context, the tool outputs step-by-step testing guides, including descriptions, pre-conditions, testing steps, and expected results.

Features
Text Box for Optional Context: Allows users to provide additional context or specific details about the features to be tested.
Multi-Image Uploader: Users can upload multiple screenshots of the digital product's features.
Generate Testing Instructions: A button to trigger the LLM to process the inputs and generate detailed testing instructions.
Output: A step-by-step guide on how to test each feature, including:
Description: Overview of what the test case is about.
Pre-conditions: Requirements that need to be set up before testing.
Testing Steps: Clear instructions on how to execute the test.
Expected Result: The expected outcome if the feature works correctly.
Tech Stack
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally React for a more dynamic interface.
Back-end: Flask (Python) or Node.js with Express.
LLM Integration: Using a multimodal LLM model from OpenAI, Hugging Face, or another provider that supports image and text input.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (for React-based front-end).
Python and pip (for Flask back-end).
Access to a multimodal LLM model that can process images and text inputs (like OpenAI's DALL-E or similar models from Hugging Face).
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-llm-testing-instructions.git
cd multimodal-llm-testing-instructions
Set Up the Back-end

For Flask:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
For Node.js with Express:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Set Up the Front-end

If using React:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Configuration
API Keys: If your multimodal LLM requires API keys, ensure these are set up in a .env file in the backend directory:
makefile
Copy code
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
LLM_API_ENDPOINT=your_llm_endpoint
Running the Application
Start the Back-end

For Flask:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
flask run
For Node.js with Express:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the Front-end

If using React:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (for React) or the relevant URL for your front-end setup.

Usage
Upload Screenshots: Click on the image uploader and select the screenshots of the digital product's features you want to test.
Add Context (Optional): Use the text box to provide any additional context or instructions that might help the LLM generate more accurate test cases.
Generate Instructions: Click the 'Describe Testing Instructions' button. The LLM will process the screenshots and context, then output detailed testing instructions.
Review Test Cases: The output will include a description, pre-conditions, testing steps, and expected results for each feature identified in the screenshots.
